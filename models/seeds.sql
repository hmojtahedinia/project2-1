		('Han Ba Tang', '4862 Yonge Street', 7, ' I found it very weird that the inside of the stalls did not match the same rustic wood panelling as the rest of the bathroom.'),
        ('Pancho y Emiliano', '291 King Street West', 7, 'Absolutely spotless, apart from single piece of toilet paper next to the toilet. Loved the subway tiles and the vintage hand dryer. Bonus points for having both paper towel and hand dryer. Would definitely poop again.'),
        ('ZED 80', '185 Danforth Avenue ', 7, 'There was a bag of clothes next to the toilet the entire night. Bonus points for having both paper towel and hand dryer. Bonus, bonus points for Garbage Pail Kids! '),
        ('Air Canada Centre', '40 Bay Street', 6, 'Though loss for the Raptors tonight. The smell of urine and overpriced beer permeated the air. Vanity covered in water. Urinals, urinals everywhere.'),
        ('Glass Onion Bistro', '1316 Bloor Street West', 6, 'The faint sound of a cat meowing was heard. A search of the basement was conducted to find the source, but to no avail. Decent bathroom.'),
        ('Toys "R" Us (Dufferin Mall)', '900 Dufferin Street', 6, 'I"m going to assume that it was just cleaned before I got there because I"ve heard horror stories about this particular bathroom. There was an unpleasant lingering smell in the air (most definitely from the employee that was exiting as I was entering).'),

        ('Dufferin Mall', '900 Dufferin St', 6, 'The smell hit me as soon as I walked in. Water pressure of sinks was worst I"ve encountered yet. Took me a good 5 minutes to wash all of the soap off my hands. Speaking of soap, it had a weird smell to it. Not a good smell, but not bad either.'),
        ('Kramer"s Bar & Grill', '1915 Yonge Street', 7, 'The Jack Daniel"s soap dispensers were super cool. Decent bar bathroom with option of paper towel or hand dryer.'),
